# Brain Tumor Detection (MATLAB)

This project detects brain tumours from MRI images using MATLAB image processing techniques such as preprocessing, segmentation, and morphological operations.

## ✅ Features
- Tumour region segmentation
- Tumour mask generation
- Highlighted output image
- Best accuracy on **high-contrast MRI images**

## 📂 Project Structure
- `brain_tumor_detection.m` → Main MATLAB script  
- `images/` → Input MRI images  
- `outputs/` → Generated tumour masks and detection outputs  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Place your MRI image in the `images/` folder
3. Run:
   ```matlab
   brain_tumor_detection
